# HBSS_Cont
HBSS_Cont is a MATLAB toolbox for nonlinear frequency response analysis using Harmonic Balance in extended state space with pseudo-arc-length continuation. It supports stability analysis via Floquet multipliers and automatic detection of Fold, Period-Doubling, and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations.
